# SD-IMM-code-for-hydrodynamic-estimation-using-Lagrangian-sensor
This repository contains:
1- The data of multiple Eulerian sensors mounted at actual irrigation channel and GPS position data of a Lagrangian sensor floating in the irrigation channel.  
2- code for state dependent interacting multiple models (SD-IMM) with Kalman filter.
